# Doing Data Science
My own solutions in R/Python for the exercises in the book Doing Data Science by Rachel Schutt and Cathy O'Neil.

There is no the "right" solution when it's come to data science process. We should think what patterns will be important to spot and interpret for our company/project/problem. We have to understand the data, gain intuition, understand the shape of it, and try to connect our understanding of the process that generated the data to the data itself. Data Science happens between you and the data and is not about proving anything to anyone else yet.
